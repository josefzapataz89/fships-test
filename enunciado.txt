There are n chips arranged in a circle, numbered from 1 to n.

Initially each chip has black or white color. Then k iterations occur. During each iteration the chips change their colors according to the following rules. For each chip i, three chips are considered: chip i itself and two its neighbours. If the number of white chips among these three is greater than the number of black chips among these three chips, then the chip i becomes white. Otherwise, the chip i becomes black.

Note that for each i from 2 to (n-1) two neighbouring chips have numbers (i-1) and (i+1). The neighbours for the chip i=1 are n and 2. The neighbours of i=n are (n-1) and 1.

Your task is to determine the color of each chip after k iterations.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (3=n=200000,1=k=10^9) — the number of chips and the number of iterations, respectively.

The second line contains a string consisting of n characters "W" and "B". If the i-th character is "W", then the i-th chip is white initially. If the i-th character is "B", then the i-th chip is black initially.

Output
Print a string consisting of n characters "W" and "B". If after k iterations the i-th chip is white, then the i-th character should be "W". Otherwise the i-th character should be "B".
